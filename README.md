# SuperDuck
XFlow and SolidWorks integration with C#

This program is designed to launch solidworks with a part, and tweak the parts globals according to the results from a neural network trained from data from XFlow. The program uses google's tensorflow.net library, and SSHs into a machine with XFlow installed on it to run the simulations and grab the data.
